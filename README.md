# Camel Skeleton

It took me quite a while to get started with Camel, especially to setup the environment around it.
I want to share my skeleton apps to help other people that they can focus on working with Camel and trying
out the examples on the page, rather than searching for boilerplate-snippets on the web

## Two approaches

- Maven as build program and Java as main language
- Gradle as build program and Groovy as main language

Using the former makes it easier to try the examples on the official page, the latter is a bit more
flexible and I prefer Groovy because I can get stuff done with less code and less fuss

## What is this camel?

I think Amr Mostafa already gave the best answer to this question on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8845186/what-exactly-is-apache-camel#answer-11540451)

## Send me pull requests!

I'm pretty new to Camel / Groovy / Gradle / Maven, so if you have improvements, let me know!
