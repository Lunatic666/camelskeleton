# Camel Skeleton

It took me quite a while to get started with Camel, especially to setup the environment around it.
I want to share my skeleton app to help other people, that they can focus on working with Camel and trying
out the examples on the page, rather than searching for boilerplate-snippets on the web.

## Send me pull requests!

I'm pretty new to Camel / Groovy / Gradle / Maven, so if you have improvements, let me know!
